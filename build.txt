Building:
Setup WSL, Cygwin, MSYS, or use some other Linux environment.
Install the Crypto++ and NTL libraries from
https://libntl.org/doc/tour-unix.html
https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/blob/master/Install.txt

Compile with a command similar to:
gcc -O2 src.cpp -o out.elf -L/usr/local/lib -lcryptopp -lntl -lgmp -lm -pthread
where src.cpp is the module you want to compile.
Run the compiled program with ./out.elf
